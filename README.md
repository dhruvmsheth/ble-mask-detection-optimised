Until the threat of this pandemic has been neutralized, people should embrace the protection masks allow them to provide to those around them.

After all, it’s not necessarily about you — it’s about everyone you come in contact with.

It’s not at all uncommon to be an asymptomatic carrier of the new coronavirus — which means that even if you have no symptoms at all, you could potentially transmit the virus to someone who could then become gravely ill or even die.

Adhering to this, I decided to increase the necessity of wearing face-masks along with touch-free systems to increase safety in malls and supermarkets. Along with the person detection algorithm, I decided to make a custom face mask detection model which detects face masks and displays this data on the ThingSpeak IoT dashboard to increase awareness among mall staff as well as the visitors coming inside so that they are aware of the time trends when the most number of people are without masks. Through this there is a increases of sense of warning and awareness in people to wear masks. Accordingly, the store staff can keep a monitor on these trends and increase restrictions based on data driven statistics.
